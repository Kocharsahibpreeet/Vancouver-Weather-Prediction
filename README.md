Project Overview

We will use past data to make a forecast for the next day's weather in the City of Vancouver. First, we'll get a copy of some local meteorological data by downloading a dataset. This may be altered to suit your specific geographic region. After that, we'll prepare the information for machine learning by eliminating any lingering messes. We'll construct a model to forecast the future based on the past. After that, we'll supplement the model with more predictors. Predictions for tomorrow will round up our discussion.
